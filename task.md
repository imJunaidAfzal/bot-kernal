# Bot Kernel LLM Code Challenge

 ## Challenge Description

Your challenge is to create a chat bot that can turn input prompt into sql, query a table using the generated SQL and return the response to the user.

**Backend - Python**
Steps
    1) Generate a table with random data. (Ex a table of trades)
    2) Give chatbot access to table
    3) Receive a prompt from a user, prompt engineer and generate a SQL statement from said input.
    4) Execute SQL and return response to user.
    5) You can use open source models or include an env for openai api key
    
    Notes: 
     1) Ensure you include an engineered prompt, do not use LangChain agent for this part.
     2) Startup script should include DB population ( use a standard SQL db like psql) 
     


**Development and Build Environment**

Your application should have a fully working development environment. Instructions should be provided on how to run the application in a development setting.

**Submission Guidelines**

Please submit your code in a GitHub repository. It should include:

1. Source code.
3. A README file containing instructions on how to set up and run your application, including installing dependencies, running tests, starting the development server, and building the project.
4. Any additional documentation you feel necessary to understand your design and development decisions.


Finally, just to reiterate, we're not just looking at if the final product works, but also your approach, code quality, choice of libraries, and general adherence to best practices. Good luck!
